# Predictive Analysis of Ride Demand for Uber and Lyft in Boston, MA

## 1. Introduction
Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft have revolutionized urban transportation. Accurately predicting ride demand can help optimize driver allocation, reduce passenger wait times, and improve overall service efficiency. This project aims to develop a predictive model for ride demand in Boston, MA, leveraging historical ride data, weather conditions, and traffic patterns.

## 2. Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to predict ride demand in Boston, MA.
- Identify key factors influencing ride demand, such as weather, time of day, and location.
- Provide insights to optimize ride distribution and reduce wait times for passengers.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using relevant metrics.

## 3. Project Plan

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
  Handle missing values, address outliers, and format inconsistencies in the dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Identify temporal patterns, geographical hotspots, and correlations between factors and ride demand.

- **Model Development:**  
  Implement Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to predict ride demand for specific locations and time intervals. Train sentiment analysis models using NLP techniques to understand user satisfaction and demand shifts. Perform feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- **Dynamic Pricing Simulation:**  
  Explore the potential for optimizing pricing strategies based on predicted demand.


## 4. Expected Outcomes
- A predictive model that provides real-time ride demand forecasts.
- Interactive visualizations showing demand hotspots in Boston.
- Insights into the impact of weather and traffic on ride-hailing demand.
- Recommendations for Uber and Lyft to improve driver allocation strategies.

## 5. Challenges & Mitigation
- **Data Availability:** Some datasets may have missing or inconsistent records. We will use interpolation to supplement missing data.
- **Feature Engineering Complexity:** Selecting the right features can be challenging. We will apply domain knowledge and statistical methods for feature selection.

## 6. Conclusion
This project aims to enhance the efficiency of Uber and Lyft ride services by accurately forecasting ride demand in Boston, MA. By leveraging machine learning and external data sources, we can provide actionable insights that benefit both riders and drivers, ultimately improving urban mobility.
